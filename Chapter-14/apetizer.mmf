  "Your party will be the best one of the year when you serve this special
  dip baked inside a loaf of bread. It will be the centerpiece of the table
  and the centerpiece of the party, too."
  
  drained and cut into quarters Garlic bread for serving
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut a hole about 5 inches in diameter in the
  top of the bread. (If you wish, make a decorative zigzag pattern.) Reserve
  crusty part to make top for loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion
  of the loaf and save for another purpose, such as stuffing or bread crumbs.
  In a skillet, saute' the scallions and garlic in the butter until scallions
  wilt. Do not burn! Place the cream cheese in a medium sized bowl; add the
  scallions, garlic, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese. Mix well. Fold in the
  artichoke hearts. Fill hollowed-out bread with this mixture. Replace top of
  bread and wrap in a double thickness of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bake for
  about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours. Remove foil and top of bread and serve, using
  thin slices of warm garlic bread as dippers.
  
  Note: The best part of this dish is when the dip is gone and all you have
  left is the breadd, which is soaked in all those delicious ingredients.
  Just break the bread up and pass it around!

 Categories: Appetizers

  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter or oil; melted/cooled
 
  Mixing crepes by hand.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Break the eggs into another bowl and
  mix until yolks and whites are blended.  Make a hole in the middle of the
  dry ingredients and pour in beaten eggs.  (French chefs often break the
  eggs right into the dry ingredients but this makes mixing more difficult.
  
  Stir the flour mixture into the eggs little by little.  The dough will be
  difficult to work and it may be necessary to add a little milk (or whatever
  liquid is used in the particular recipe) to incorporate all the flour. Add
  the liquid a spoonful at a time and mix it in thoroughly before adding more
  liquid.  When the mixture becomes easy to work (when about half of the
  liquid has been used) the remainder can be added in two portions.
  
  Add melted butter (and flavorings if indicated).
  
  Mix again, cover and set aside for at least an hour but not more than 6
  hours at room temperature.  Crepe batter can be held overnight in the
  refrigerater.  If necessary, the crepe batter can be cooked immediately,
  but the "resting" time allows the flour to absorb more liquids, makes the
  mabber easier to handle, and gives the crepes more flavor.  Since flours
  vary in their ability to absorb liquid, if the crepe batter seems too thick
  when you are ready to cook it, a small amount of extra liquid can be added
  at this time.  The consistency could be at least as thin as heavy cream.

  the wine in the dish and bring it to a boil.  Slowly start adding cheese to
  the boiling wine, and stir constantly until each bit is dissolved, then add
  more.  When all the cheese is in, stir the kirsch into the cornstarch well,
  then add the mixture to the cheese and keep stirring over the heat until
  the mixture comes to a boil again.  Add freshly ground pepper and nutmeg to
  taste.  -- Remove the dish to on top of a small live flame (Sterno or
  alcohol burner) and keep it bubbling slowly. Bread should have been cubed
  ~- about 1-inch cubes -- for spearing with fondue forks and stirring around
  in the cheese.  The old custom is that if you accidentally lose the bread
  into the cheese from the end of your fork, if you're male, you have to buy
  a round of drinks for the table: if you're female, you have to kiss
  everybody.  (Hmm.) .
  
  Other fondue info:  Do not drink water with fondue -- it reacts unkindly in
  your stomach with the cheese and bread.  Dry white wine or tea are the
  usual accompaniments.  Another tradition:  the "coupe d'midi", or "shot in
  the middle", for when you get full:  a thimbleful of Kirsch, knocked
  straight back in the middle of the meal, usually magically produces more
  room if you're feeling too full.  Don't ask me how this works...it just
  does.  -- The crusty bit that forms at the bottom of the pot as the cheese
  keeps cooking is called the "crouton", and is very nice peeled off and
  divvied up among the guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.

  This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the younger
  generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few minutes (or in
  one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide will blister and
  come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid. Then roast or boil until
  tender. This is considered very strengthening food (use only young beaver).
  For a special treat, cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and

  3 3/4 oz Pastry flour -=OR=-

           -(or creme fraiche)
           Butter; melted
 
  COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS for the crepes, except the butter. Whisk well and
  pass through a fine strainer. Let rest 1 hour. Add butter before cooking
  the crepes. Cook the crepes and be careful not to brown them. Lay the crepe
  out on a piece of parchment or a clean towel (don't lay out more than 12 at
  a time or they will dry out). Fill with a spoonful of caviar and sour
  cream. Pull the edges of the crepes up to form small purses and tie with a
  chive. Serve warm or at room temperature, lightly brushed with butter.
  These crepes can also be rolled or folded in the more traditional manner if
  forming the purses seems like a daunting task. The result is beautiful,
  however, and worth the extra effort.
  
  This elegant recipe comes from Katherine Alford, chief instructor at the
  New York Cooking School. Katherine used to be the chef at the Quilted
  Giraffe in New York. These crepes are a signature dish of that restaurant.

      1 tb Olive oil
      3 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine
      1 sm (3oz) onion, coarsely
           -chopped
     16 oz Can salt free whole tomatoes
      1 c  (about 48) medium sized
           -canned, low salt, pitted
           -black olives,drained and
 
  Most of us tend to think of olives as a salty-fatty food.  But it's
  possible to buy low salt black olives, featured in the Mediterranean style
  sauce, that have all the good flavor without all of the salt. Yes, the
  capers that lend spark to the sauce are themselves salty; but you can cut
  down on their saltiness by choosing a brand that ranks salt further down,
  and thus in lesser concentration-on the ingredients list,and then draining
  and rinsing the capers well before adding them.  Serve with medium to large
  strands, ribbons, or shapes.
  
  broken by hand or chopped into about 4 pieces each 3 tbsp capers, drained
  and rinsed 1 tbsp balsamic or good quality red wine vinegar 1 tbsp double
  concentrate tomato paste 2 tsp sugar 1/2 tbsp dried oregano
  
  In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil with the garlic and
  onion over moderate heat.  When they sizzle, add the tomatoes, breaking
  them up with your hands.  Then stir in the remaining ingredients. Simmer
  the sauce until it is thick but still slightly liquid, 5-7 minutes.  Serve
  over cooked pasta. Serves 4.

      1 c  Buckwheat flour (available
           -at natural foods stores and
           Specialty foods shops)
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
 
  (Buckwheat Yeast Pancakes With Three Caviars) from 1989
  
  a 1/4-ounce package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast about 2 cups sour
  cream as an accompaniment about 4 ounces each black caviar, golden caviar,
  and salmon roe
  
  In a large bowl proof the yeast with 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar in 1/3 cup
  lukewarm water for 10 minutes, or until it is foamy. Stir in 1 cup of the
  milk, heated to lukewarm, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons
  of the butter, and the buckwheat flour, beat the batter for 1 minute, and
  let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 2 hours or
  chill it, covered tightly, overnight. (Chilling overnight produces a
  tangier flavor. Let the batter come to room temperature before continuing
  with the recipe.) Stir in the remaining 1 cup milk, heated to lukewarm, the
  all-purpose flour, the salt, and the yolks, beat the mixture for 1 minute,
  and let it rise, covered with the plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour,
  or until it is double in bulk and bubbly. In a bowl beat the cream until it
  holds soft peaks and fold it into the batter. In a metal bowl beat the egg
  whites until they just hold stiff peaks and fold them into the batter
  gently but thoroughly.
  
  Heat a griddle or large skillet over moderate heat until it is hot, brush
  it lightly with the additional melted butter, and spoon tablespoons of the
  batter onto the griddle, spreading them to form 3-inch rounds. Cook the
  blini for 1 minute on each side, or until the undersides are golden.
  Transfer the blini as they are cooked to a platter and keep them warm,
  covered with a kitchen towel. Make blini with the remaining batter in the
  same manner, brushing the griddle lightly with the butter as necessary. The
  blini may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat
  the blini, covered with foil, in a 350~ F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or
  until they are warm, or microwave them on a microwave-safe platter, covered
  with microwave-safe plastic wrap, at high power (100%) for 2 minutes, or
  until they are warm.
  
  Arrange 3 or 4 blini on each of 18 small plates, top them with some of the
  sour cream, and arrange some of the caviar decoratively on the sour cream.
  Serves 18 with blini to spare.

   Servings:  1
 
    1/2 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Flour, part for rolling
      2 tb Margarine or butter
    1/4 ts Salt
        pn Paprika
        pn Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Water
 
  Mix all together in a bowl.  Original directions suggested shaping into a
  roll 1 1/2 inch wide, chilling at least 2 hours wrapped in wax paper and
  cutting in thin slices to make 1 dozen or more crackers.  This would
  produce neatly shaped crackers, possibly thicker than desired.
  
  By rolling very thin, this amount of dough will make small crackers about
  1/2 inch apart to cover 1 1/2 small cookie sheets.  They do puff up while
  baking.  May be cut quickly in random small shapes with a plastic knife.
  
  Suggested toppings coarse salt (made them too salty), garlic salt, celery
  salt, curry powder, or freshly ground black pepper.  If the dough is very
  dry after rolling, brush tops with water before salting.  If it is soft,
  sprinkle lightly and press the salt into the crackers.
  
  Bake 5 minutes at 425 F or until browned.

      Title: Cheese Straws
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings: 20
 
      1 lb Puff pastry
    3/4 c  Parmesan; grated
 
      1.  Roll out puff pastry dough into a rectangle 20 by 24 inches.
  Sprinkle half of the Parmesan evenly over the dough and gently press cheese
  into the dough with the rolling pin.
      2.  Fold the dough in half crosswise, roll it out again to 20 by 24
  inches, and sprinkle on remaining cheese.
      3.  Using a sharp thin knife, cut the dough into 1/3-inch strips. Take
  each strip by its end and twist until evenly corkscrewed.  Lay the twists
  of dough on an ungreased baking sheet, arranged so they are just touching
  each other; this will prevent untwisting.
      4.  Set the baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350F oven and
  bake until the straws are crisp, puffed brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
      5.  Remove from the oven, cool for 5 minutes, then cut apart with a
  sharp knife.  Finish cooling the straws on a rtack, then store them in an
  airtight tin or plastic bag until serving time.  They will stay fresh for
  about 1 week. About 20 straws. Arrange a basketful on the bar when
  entertaining and watch them disappear! Source: The Silver Palate Cookbook

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

  Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes
  
  Parsley, lemon wedges, tartar sauce as desired
  
  Using an electric blender or wire whisk, beat together mustard, lemon juice
  and egg until thoroughly combined.  While  beating vigorously, gradually
  pour 4 Tbs of olive oil  into  the  egg mixture in a thin stream. When
  smooth and creamy, stir in salt and pepper.
  
  Gently fold in crabmeat, then bread crumbs and cayenne  pepper. Shape into
  8 patties, each about a half-inch thick. They  will want to fall apart, but
  that's the idea of a good  crab  cake. You want only enough non-crab stuff
  to just barely bind them.
  
  Melt  butter together with 2 Tbs of olive oil in  skillet  over medium
  heat.  When butter sizzles (but before it burns!) gently ease the crab
  cakes into the skillet  to  cook.   When  well browned (2 to 3 minutes),
  gently turn and  cook  other  side. Drain on paper towels. Serve
  immediately.

      Title: Cocktail Crunch
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  1
 
      3 oz Rye flakes
      3 oz Jumbo oat flakes
      3 oz Barley flakes
      3 oz Wheat flakes
      3 oz Peanut kernals *see note
      2 oz Flaked almonds
      2 oz Sunflower seeds
      1 ts (heaped) coriander seeds
      1 ts (heaped) cumin seeds
      1 tb Garam marsala
      1 ts Tumeric
      3 tb Sesame oil
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Water
 
  *Note: Peanuts should not be salted or dry roast.
  
  Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and seeds
  on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 and put the
  baking trays into the oven while it heats up.  Meanwhile measure the flaked
  grains and mix them together in a large bowl.  Put into a cup the garam
  marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black pepper, a scrunch of sea salt,
  the soy, both sorts of oil and the water.
  
  When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and seed
  mixture with the flaked grains.  Beat the spicy oil-and-water mixture with
  a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients and stir for 2
  minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking trays and bake for 40
  minutes until golden.  Swap the positions of the trays in the oven at least
  once during this time and stir the mixture occasionally to encourage even
  cooking.  Let the mixture become cold and crunchy before storing in an
  airtight jar.  It keeps well for about a month.  Makes enough to fill one
  jar.

      Title: Cold Crabmeat Nacho
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
   Servings:  1
 
     24 oz Cream cheese
      2 tb Mayonnaise; the real thing
        ds Tabasco
    1/4 c  Green onions; minced
    1/4 c  Celery; coarsely chopped
        ds Paprika
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      1 cn Black olives; finely
           -chopped (16 oz. can)
    1/2 lb Crabmeat; flaked
      1    Nacho cheese flavor doritos
 
      The best way to prepare this recipe in a food processor, because it
  chops the ingredients finely enough and blends them together for you. But
  if a food processor is not handy, you can use a blender and a chef's
  kniofe.  It will still come out great, no matter how you do it!
      First, mix the cream cheese to a pasty consistency.  It has to be soft
  and pliable.  THen, in a large mixing bowl, whip together the cheese and
  the mayonnaise until the mixture is smooth.  Toss in the Tabasco at this
  point and blend it in, too.  Next, add the minced onions, the celery, the
  seasonings, the finely chopped black olives, and the crabmeat. Just put
  them all together -- it's not necessary to add them one at a time. But is
  *is* necessary to blend them all *gently*. If you get rough, you'll smash
  the ingredients and you'll lose the crispness.
      When you're ready to serve, lay out the *whole* bag of Doritos on a
  pizza pan and stuff each one, heaping on the crabmeat mixture and
  sprinkling the tops with paprika.  To increase the flavor, put the stuffed
  chips in the refrigerator for an hour or two. Author's note: ...While
  crabmeat is used in the original dish, you can also substitute chopped
  shrimp or crawfish for the crabmeat, and the basic mix is also excellent
  for stuffing avocados, tomatoes, celery stalks, and just about anyting your
  taste dictates. Note from me: I don't care for Nacho Cheese Flavor Doritos
  but instead these are great with the unsalted style chips you get with
  salsa at Mexican restaurants. Source: Frank Davis Seafood Notebook

 Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
   Servings:  6
 
    3/4 c  Dry White Wine
      8    Basil Leaves
      3    Tarragon (Plus Garnish)
      3    Shallots, Minced
      2    Rosemary
      2    Lemon Slices
      3    Celery Leaves
      7 lb Whole Salmon, Cleaned, Rinse
      8 c  Fish Aspic  (See Recipe)
      1    Turnip
      1    Egg Yolk, Hard Cooked, Mash
      1 ts Unsalted Butter
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the wine, basil, 3 tarragon sprigs, shallots,
  rosemary, lemon, and celery.  Simmer the mixture for 20 minutes or until
  the liquid is reduced to about 3 T.  Lay the salmon on a piece of heavy
  foil, twice as long as the fish.  Pick up edges of foil and pour the wine
  mixture over the fish.  Season with salt and fold the foil to enclose  it,
  crimping the edges tightly to secure them.  Put the salmon on a large
  baking sheet or roasting pan and bake it in the middle of a preheated 375ºF
  oven for 50-60 minutes or until the fish just flakes.  Transfer the package
  to a work surface, open foil carefully, and remove the skin from the top of
  the salmon below the head to the bottom of the salmon at the tail. Scrape
  away any brown flesh, leaving head and tail intact.  Drain liquid from the
  foil, and using the foil as a guide, invert the fish onto a platter. Remove
  foil and skin and prepare the other side of the salmon in the same manner.
  Chill the fish, covered, overnight.  Peel turnip and cut into thin slices.
  Trim each slice to ressemble a flower or cut with a flower cutter. Place in
  a bowl of ice water to hold until ready for use. Mash the egg yolk with the
  butter and reserve at room temperature.  Spoon a thin coat of cool but
  liquid fish aspic over the salmon and arrange the additional tarragon
  sprigs and turnip flowers decoratively on the fish. Spoon a thin coat of
  liquid aspic over the whole.  Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry bag
  fitted with a decorative tip.  Pipe the mixture into the centers of the
  flowers.  Chill the salmon for at least 2 hours or up to 6 hours. Serve
  surrounded with the chilled aspic, chopped. A 1964 Gourmet Magazine

      Title: Country Pate
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Veal
   Servings:  3
 
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork, ground fine
           -twice
      1 lb Boneless veal, ground fine
           -twice
    3/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Brandy
      2 tb Oil
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 lg Onions, sliced thin
      2 sm Cloves garlic, halved
      1 lb Fresh pork fatback, sliced
           -thin
      1    Cornichon pickle for garnish
 
  Servings: Makes about 3 lbs From: Sallie Krebs
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, combine the pork and veal. Mix the wine,
  brandy and oil with salt and pepper to taste, and pour the mixture over the
  meats. Scatter the onions and garlic on top. Cover the bowl tightly and
  refrigerate it for at least 24 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375-F. Discard the onions, but put the garlic through a
  press and knead it into the meats together with the wine mixture. Break off
  a small piece of meat and fry it in a lightly oiled skillet over moderate
  heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until its juices run clear, without a trace of
  pink. Taste the piece and, if you like, add more garlic, salt and pepper.
  (Pork is unsafe to eat uncooked; do not taste the meats raw.)
  
  Slightly overlapping the slices, line the bottom and sides of a 2-quart
  terrine mold or a 7 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan with the fatback.
  Pack the meat mixture into the mold, and arrange the remaining slices of
  fatback on top of it. Fit foil over the mold, or cover the meat mixture
  with foil and a lid. To let steam escape, pierce a hole in the foil with a
  skewer. If you are using a lid, insert the skewer through its hole to
  puncture the foil.
  
  Set the mold on a rack in a large pan or dish. Place them all in the oven,
  and pour enough almost-boiling water into the pan to cover 2/3 of the mold.
  Bake for 2 hours or until the pate shrinks slightly from the sides of the
  mold and the surrounding fat and juices are a clear yellowish white with no
  traces of pink. Or insert a meat thermometer; it should register 160-F when
  the pate is done.
  
  Take the pate from the oven, but leave the foil in place. Set the pate on a
  rack to cool to room temperature. Then put another pan with a heavy can or
  weights inside it, or even a brick, on top of the pate to compact the
  meats. Chill the pate thoroughly (overnight is best) with the weights in
  place. Before serving, cut the cornichon into a fan shape, slicing
  lengthwise through the pickle 4 or 5 times to within 1/2 inch of one end.
  Spread the slices into a fan, and garnish the pate with it.

      2 tb Dill weed
      2 tb Onion Flakes
      2 tb Parsley Flakes
 
  Start the day before, or atleast early in the day to serve in the evening.
  The dry ingredients need time to soften, and get friendly.  Mix all
  ingredients and refrigerate over night.
  
  Carve out the bread  to make a bowl, saving the bread to dip into the
  sauce.
  
  When ready to serve, put the dip inside the bread, arange the bread pieces
  around the 'bowl'. When the pieces are gone, slice, rip, or tear the
  remaining crust and eat.
  
  We had a bakery in Baltimore that made a great Sweedish/Onion Rye, although
  that was the name on the bread, they claimed that there was nothing special
  about it. I have served it with plain 'store bought' rye, the round loaves
  and with my own home made rye.

      1    Stick (1/2 cup) butter or
           -margarine, softened
      1 c  Cottage cheese
 
  With carrots, celery, green pepper strips, cucumber slices, cherry
  tomatoes, cauliflower pieces or crackers, try any of the following:
  
  CHEESE SPREAD
  
  garlic powder
  
  Blend shortening with cottage cheese. A blender or baby food grinder will
  give you a smoother consistency than whipping with a fork. Add garlic
  powder to taste. Refrigerate in a covered container.
  
  DIP IT AGAIN
  
  1 (8 oz) container of plain yogurt 1 cup sour cream 1 pkg onion soup mix
  
  Combine and chill before serving.
  
  BETTER-WITH-BUTTERMILK DIP
  
  1 cup buttermilk 2 cups mayonnaise 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1 envelope
  Ranch style dressing mix
  
  Stir together and chill. For use as salad dressing, substitute a second cup
  of buttermilk for the sour cream or yogurt.
  
  Hint: Use cucumber "coins" instead of crackers.
  
  OTHER QUICK DIPPIES that make up in small quantities:
  
  * Blend 1/3 to 1/2 of a mashed banana with 2 or 3 tsps of mayonnaise.
  
  * Whipe together 1 tsp of smooth peanut butter with 1 tsp of mayonnaise. If
  still too thick, add a few drops of milk.
  
  * Mix 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of honey or sugar to 1 or 2 tsp of
  mayonnaise.
  
  CUTTING UP WITH KIDS
  
  Have your children help you cut up green onions, parsley, lettuce, cheese
  slices, fruit, etc., using a scissors instead of a knife. Using a scissors
  helps coordination (YES!) and keeps them busy for a _long_ time!
  
  CHERRY BALLS
  
  Stuff whole (or half) cherry tomatoes with cream cheese, a cheese spread,
  egg salad or tuna salad.
  
  Actually thinking of snacks as hors d'oeuvres - rather than desserts - will
  open up a whole new way of looking at this category.

           LIME CREAM SAUCE
           (see note)
      1 tb Oil
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Lime juice
 
  Salt and white pepper to taste Sprigs of fresh coriander
  
  Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let stand for 10 minutes.
  Rinse thoroughly, drain and pat dry.
  
  Finely chop shrimp and put them in a mixing bowl.
  
  Add remaining salt, ginger, rice wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts, green
  onions, coriander, sausage and cheese to mix- ture; mix thoroughly.
  
  If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corner to make a circle.
  
  Place 1 heaping teaspoon filling in the center of 1 wrapper. Moisten the
  edge of the wrapper with water and fold in half to enclose filling and form
  a half-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal.
  
  Set on a baking sheet; cover with a towel. Repeat with remaining filling
  and wrappers.
  
  To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a 10-inch
  nonstick skillet and set over medium heat.
  
  Arrange 12 gyozas in one single layer; pan-fry for 1 minute or until
  lightly browned. Turn the gyozas over to brown other side, about 1 minute
  longer.
  
  Add chicken stock, shake pan to prevent gyozas from stick- ing. Cover and
  cook at low boil for 2 minutes. Remove gyozas to a plate; keep warm.
  
  Increase heat under skillet to high, add cream; bring to a boil stirring
  for 45 seconds until thickened. Stir in lime juice.
  
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  To serve, divide the sauce among 4 plates. Arrange 3 gyozas on each.
  Garnish with fresh coriander springs.
  
  Note: There is enough filling to make 4 dozen gyozas. The amount of sauce
  indicated above is enough for 12 gyozas. If you want to make more, multiple
  the sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will have to make the
  sauce separately as part of each batch. Freeze extra uncooked gyozas on a
  baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag. Do not defrost
  before browning.
  
  Makes 4 dozen gyozas. Serves 16.

      1 tb Olive oil
           Salt to taste
 
  A favorite Valencian tapa as well as a popular main dish, especially along
  the Costa Blanca. A cold beer might go best with this piquant tapa.
  
  Clean and skin eels and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon
  olive oil in a casserole or skillet, add paprika, and stir in enough water
  to cover eels. Bring to a boil and add pieces of eel. Meanwhile with a
  mortar and pestle or in an electric blender crush garlic, almonds, parsley,
  and saffron with enough olive oil to make a smooth paste. Stir mixture into
  casserole, add salt to taste, and cook for about 20 minutes or until eels
  are done. Add more water if sauce thickens. Serve hot.
  
  Variation: For an all-in-one meal or a main course, add peas, chopped
  carrots, or new potatoes (or all three) and serve over rice, as they do in
  Valencia.

  In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl, combine all
  the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of the chopped
  scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to blend well. In a
  8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a quarter of the egg
  mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat until the egg pancake has
  barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make 3 more pancakes. Divide the
  filling into 4 portions and put a portions on each pancake. Moisten your
  fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the
  surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll.
  Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls
  on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an
  inch of simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the slant.
  Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens and the
  carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

      1 c  Shortening
      2    Whole eggs

           Water, as needed
      3 tb Flour
    1/4 c  Cooked peas
      8    Pitted green olives, chopped
           Cayenne pepper
      1    Egg beaten with a pinch of
           -salt for glaze
 
  Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas
  
  Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled with
  chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil. Empanadas
  are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are
  wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. "The secret
  to making good dough," says Belita, "is to massage it, not knead it." It
  may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb.
  
  For the dough:
  
  To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a
  well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup
  water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through
  your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the
  dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough
  should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare
  the filling.
  
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium
  heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay
  leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a
  boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is
  cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken,
  then strain and reserve the broth.
  
  When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the
  meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food
  processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth;
  the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the
  chicken a little bite.
  
  Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet
  molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just
  reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust.
  
  Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to
  capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to
  Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching
  together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared
  ahead to this stage and frozen.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30
  minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve.

      Title: Empanadas - S. American
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  1
 
MMMMM------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all purpose
    2/3 c  Shortening or lard
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 tb Water

MMMMM--------------------------DESSERT FRUIT-------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Fruit
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Nutmeg

MMMMM-------------------------CARNE ( ANY MEAT------------------------------
      1    Onion
      1 tb Olive oil
      4 oz Water
           Sal and Pepper to taste
      1    Pepper, green
      8 oz Tomato paste
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 lb Beef, sliced thinly
 
  DOUGH:
       In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.  Cut in the
  shortening or lard till pieces are the size of small peas.  Add a small
  amount of water to slightly moisten.  Form dough into a ball.  Roll out the
  dough to about 1/8 thick and cut into 4" circles.  Flour lightly both side
  of circles and then stack up for later use.
  
  DESSERT FILLING:  Just about any kind of fruit or melon may be used.
  Combine ingredients and heat to thoroughly mix, coarse chop, so that
  filling is chunky but bite-sized.  Pumpkins is very good!!
  
  CARNE:  Just about any kind of meat may be used, depending on availability.
  The sauce seems to be the only fairly consistent thing. Saute the onion and
  green pepper in olive oil.  Add remaining ingredients and cook for 20
  minutes.  ( In S.A. this is continually cooked and prepared on the back
  burner, often being used and added to for several months at a time. It
  developes a flavor all its own...)  Add meat and coat thoroughly with the
  sauce.
  
  COOKING:  Add a large spoonfull of one of the above mixtures to the center
  of a dough circle.  Place another circle on top.  Fasten the two circles
  together by reeding the edges with a fork.  These may then be baked, at
  around 350 degrees F until brown, deep fat fried, fried, cooked or heated
  on a barbecue.  They may also be wrapped in banana husks, well moistened
  corn husks, etc.  The object is to heat thoroughly, cooking the meat and
  browning the outsides so they are dry enough to hold together.

      Title: Empanadas
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  4
 
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      2    Yolks of large eggs
    1/4 c  Chilled water
    1/2 lb Ground lean beef
    1/2 c  Chopped white onions
      2 tb Seedless raisins
      2 tb Chopped black or green
           -olives
    1/2 ts Ground red pepper (Cayenne)
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  1.  Cut the butter into 1/4 inch cubves.
  
  2.  Place the flour, baking powder, salt, and butter in a mixing bowl.
  Combine the ingredients with a pastry cutter (or with the steel blade in a
  food processor).
  
  3.  Beat the egg yolks.  Mix half of them into the flour mixture. Reserve
  the remainder for step 12.
  
  4.  Incorporate the water slowly into the flour mixture until the dough
  becomes a cohesive and semifirm mass.
  
  5.  Shape the sough into two balls.  Wrap them in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate them for 15 minutes.
  
  6.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  7.  Heat the oil in a large saute pan or skillet over moderate heat. Saute
  the meat for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer the meat with a
  slotted spoon to a warm bowl.
  
  8.  Add the onions to the pan and saute them over low to moderate heat for
  3 minutes, stirring frequently. (Add 1 or 2 extra teaspoons of oil if
  necessary).
  
  9.  Return the meat to the pan and add the remaining ingredients. Cook the
  mixture for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Reserve it for step 11.
  
  10.  Roll each ball of dough on a lightly floured board into a 1/8-inch
  thick sheet. Using a cookie cutter with a 4- to 5-inch diameter, cut out
  rounds. Collect the scraps and repeat step 10 until the dough is used up.
  
  11.  Place one tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center of each dough
  round. Lightly moisten the exposed dough with cold tap water. Fold each
  round in half, creating a half-moon shape. Crimp the two edges of dough

      6 tb Parmesan; freshly grated (i
           -mported is best)
      1 tb Parsley; fresh, chopped
 
  1.  Prepare Whole Wheat Pizza Dough through Step 3. 2. Heat small skillet
  over low heat until hot to the touch.  Add pine nuts; reduce heat to very
  low.  Toast pine nuts, shaking pan frequently, until evenly golden, about 2
  minutes.  Set aside. 3. Heat oven to 500F. Oil a 12-inch pizza pan as
  necessary for type of pan (see below for tips); sprinkle with cornmeal if
  desired. 4. Combine 1 Tablespoon of the oil, the vinegar, and galric in
  medium bowl; add zucchini and red onion, tossing to coat. 5. Complete Whole
  Wheat Pizza Dough. 6. Place dough in prepared pan; brush surface with
  remaining oil. Sprinkle half the provolone evenly over dough, leaving a
  3/4-inch border; top with even layer of zucchini mixture. Sprinkle with
  salt and pepper to taste, then with the remaining provolone, all the
  mozzarella, Bel Paese, and Gorgonzola, and half the Parmesan. Sprinkle with
  additional salt and pepper.  Bake until crust is golden, about 15 minutes.
  Scatter pine nuts evenly over surface. Bake until pine nuts and crust are
  browned, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and the
  parsley.  Serve immediately. Makes One 12-inch Pizza! Recipe from Cuisine,
  November, 1984.  See Whole Wheat Pizza Dough recipe. Which Pan for Pizza?
  Almost any type of pan can give good results, though directions for
  brushing with oil and sprinkling with cornmeal differ slightly with each.
  In fact, the use of cornmeal is not required to prevent sticking except
  when using a pizza stone, but a little sprinkled on the surface of any pan
  will give added texture to the crust. Tin-lined steel; aluminum round pizza
  pans or baking sheets:
      Generously brush the pan with olive oil. Black-finished metal baking
  sheets and pizza pans:
      Follow the manufacturer's directions for care.  Lightly brush bottom
  and sides (if any) with olive oil. Pyrex pizza pan:
      Generously brush pan with olive oil. Pizza Stone:
      Stones require preheating in a 500F oven.  They require no oiling but
  must be sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking just before the pizza
  is transferred from the peel (paddle).  The peel must also be sprinkled
  with cornmeal before the uncooked pizza is place on it for transfer to the
  heated pizza stone.  When removing the hot pizza stone from the oven, be
  careful not to set it on a cold surface, or the stone will crack.

  Dip Sauces: Mock Bernaise, Anchovy, Garlic, Mustard Plum Elite Espresso
  coffee (no recipe) Light California champagne (no recipe)
  
  ~=> Serving Suggestion Starched blue linen, crystal serving dishes, white
  porcelain and sterling champagne glasses all bring a touch of elegance to
  an intimate deck-side gathering. Arched candelabra with tall white tapes
  would be perfect for illuminating the fondue dish. Each guest could be
  handed a porcelain salad size plate with blue linen napkin folded on top
  and frosted sliver champagne glass. Remember to preheat your best demitasse
  cups for the expresso.
  
  ~=> Red Caviar Canapes chopped chives
  
  Mix onion juice, lemon juice and cream cheese.  Using a pastry tube, form a
  crown of this mixture on rounds of toast.  From the jar of caviar, take a
  dab to fill each center. Decorate the edges with chopped chives.
  
  ~=> Strawberry Surprises  (note:  NO LIE!!!) 2 lbs fresh strawberries 1 cup
  powdered sugar 1 cup light rum 1 cup vodka 1 cup Triple Sec
  
  Gouge out the stems so the hollow center of the strawberries are exposed.
  Place them in a plastic container and sprinkle the powdered sugar over
  them. Add the rum, vodka and Triple Sec and gently tumble until well mixed.
  Refrigerate covered for at least 2 days occasionally tumbling.  Gently
  remove strawberries from marinade and serve cold in pre-chilled crystal
  bowl.  Sip the marinade!!!
  
  ~=> Fondue Bourguignonne 1 1/2 lbs beef tenderloin (cheaper cuts may need
  to be tenderized) peanut oil

  dish or chafing dish until it is at least 3 inches deep. Heat the oil t
  about 360~ or until it will cokk a test chunk of meat in three minutes.
  Each guest spears a chunk of beef with a fondue fork and cooks it to taste
  in the hot oil. (It's nice to mark the forks with a colored dot on a piece
  of tape so they will be recognized). After the pieces of meat are cooked,
  each guest dips the choice morsel into one of the variety of elegant
  sauces.

      Title: Fried Leeks with Tarragon
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  4
 
      4    Leeks, about 1-in thick,
           -white parts only
      1    Egg
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Finely chopped parsley
      1 ts Tarragon
           Flour; for dredging
           Oil for frying
           -canola, lt. olive or peanut
           Tarragon vinegar
 
  TRIM THE LEEKS: Cut off the roots but leave enough so that the leaves
  remain joined at the base. Slice them in half lengthwise down to the base
  but not through it, and rinse them well. Steam them over boiling water
  until they are tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes, then set
  on a towel to cool and drain dry. Beat the egg on a plate and season with
  salt and pepper. Add the parsley and half the tarragon. Dip the leeks into
  the egg and slosh them around so that they are well covered, then dip them
  in flour to coat. Heat enough oil in a heavy pan to cover the bottom
  generously. When it is hot enough to sizzle a drop of water, add the leeks.
  Fry them, turning them frequently until they're nicely browned all over.
  Set them on a towel to drain briefly. Serve with the remaining tarragon
  sprinkled over the top and a cruet of vinegar on the side.

      1    Wheel imported Brie cheese *
           - well chilled
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 c  Sliced unblanched almonds
           Red & green seedless grapes
           - in clusters, for garnish
 
  *  The original recipe calls for "1 3/4-oz Wheel imported Brie". I think
  this might be an error, it could possibly be "One 3/4 LB wheel of Brie, but
  I don't know for sure.  -km-
  
  WITH A SMALL, flexible knife, cut away rind from top of chilled cheese. Be
  careful not to remove or split the rind on the sides. It will form a wall
  for the melted cheese. Sift 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar evenly
  over the surface and arrange almonds on top, pressing gently into place.
  The cheese can be prepared to this point as many as 2 days in advance.
  Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before
  heating, place rack 6 inches from heat source and preheat the broiler. Line
  large baking sheet with aluminum foil, place cheese on it and sift 1
  tablespoon of confectioners' sugar over nuts. Broil cheese until top is
  evenly browned--about 1 to 2 minutes. Rotate cheese, if necessary, for even
  browning. Watch carefully so it does not burn. Use foil to lift cheese and
  transfer it to serving platter. Tear foil and gently remove it. Garnish
  with clusters of grapes.

           -stemmed, and minced
      3 tb Vegetable oil
    3/4 lb Ground beef
      2 ts Each ground coriander,
           -cumin, and tumeric
      1 ts Each ground allspice and
           -cinnamon
      1    Green bell pepper, stemmed,
           -seeded, and finely chopped
      4    Tomatoes minced
      1 bn Green onions, minced
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
 
  Servings: 24 patties
  
  Pastry:
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 deg F.  To make the dough: place the flour and salt
  in a large bowl; mix well.  Cut the shortening into small pieces about the
  size of walnuts.  Add to the flour and, using your fingers, rub the flour
  and shortening together, making a coarse, mealy dough.  Add the ice water
  and gather the dough into a ball.  The dough should be firm and not sticky.
  If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, but if the dough is too
  sticky, add just enough flour to make it form a ball. Divide the dough into
  2 equal balls and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours
  or up to 2 days.
  
  To make the filling: in a large skillet, cook the onion, garlic, and
  chilies in the oil over moderate heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from
  time to time.  Add the beef, herbs, spices, bell pepper, and tomatoes, and
  cook over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly until the mixture is
  thick and saucy.  Add the green onions and cook for 1 minute. Season with
  salt and pepper and cool to room temperature.
  
  To assemble the patties:  on a lightly floured surface, divide each ball
  into 2 equal balls, so that you have 4 equal balls.  Flatten into disc
  shapes, then divide each disc into 6 equal pieces and roll each into a
  ball.  Roll each ball into a 3 1/2 inch diameter circle.  Brush the edges
  with beaten egg.  Place about 1 tablespoon of filling on one side of each
  circle, leaving a 1/4 inch border.  Fold the dough over, making a half-moon
  shape.  Seal the edges with the tines of a fork, and brush with the
  remaining egg.
  
  Bake on a lightly greased baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the
  patties are golden brown.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1    Clove garlic, minced or

  Mushroom Almond Pate
  
  Spread almonds in a shallow pan and toast in a 350 degree oven for 8
  minutes or until lightly browned
  
  Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium high heat.  Add onion,
  garlic, mushrooms, salt, thyme and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,
  until onion is soft and most of the pan juices have evaporated.
  
  In a food processor or blender, whirl almonds to form a paste,  With motor
  tunning, add oil and whirl until creamy.
  
  Add mushroom mixture and whirl until pate is smooth.
  
  Chill until set.
  
  I used walnuts, because I had them on hand, and this turned out fine.  I
  served it alongside thinly sliced toasted rounds of italian bread. Yum.
  Next to that, I had a wedge of brie surrounded by bite-sized hunks of
  carrots (cutting veggies to bite size saves the worry some people have
  about others who dip, bite, then stick something bitten back into the dip.
  . .) and a dip I make for veggies that is yummy, but not for the faint of
  heart.
  
  Spicy Yogurt Dip
  
  1 c nonfat yogurt 1 1/2 Tbsp apricot honey (or 1 Tbsp honey plus 1/2 Tbsp
  apricot preserves) 1 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
  
  Mix all ingredients together and let sit for at least an hour.  The flavor
  intensifies, but you may want to add curry and/or cayenne later. This
  tastes sweet, and you don't realize it's hot until it's too late.

  This is an easy-to-prepare dish for the quicksilver Gemini that combines
  the foods of Mercury (parsley and mushrooms) with a creamy coating. Because
  of their association with death, mushrooms are an appropriate food for the
  god whose duty was to conduct the souls of the dead to the under- world.
  Rich in minerals and vitamins, parsley helps relieve nervous conditions
  (often a Gemini complaint) and soothes the stomach. Serve this delicious
  starter with a very chilled white wine and thin slices of whole wheat bread
  and butter.

           Salt; to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           - to taste
      1 c  Minced parsley
 
  USING A 1 3/4-INCH COOKIE CUTTER, cut out rounds for the centers of the
  bread slices. Spread mayonnaise on each of the bread rounds with a small
  spatula. The diameter of the onion slices should approximate that of the
  bread rounds. Sprinkle each with salt and pepper. Place 1 onion slice on
  each half of the rounds. Cover each one with another bread round,
  mayonnaise side down, on top of the onion. Using the spatula, spread the
  outside rim of the sandwich with mayonnaise, coating fairly liberally. Roll
  the rim of each sandwich in parsley to coat.

      Title: Onion Tart
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  8
 
MMMMM------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    200 g  Plain flour
    130 g  Unsalted butter, softened
      3 tb Water
      1    Egg
      1 ds Salt

MMMMM-----------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    400 g  Onions
     30 g  Bacon, cut into thin strips
     50 g  Unsalted butter
  3 1/2 dl Cream
  3 1/2 dl Milk
      4    Eggs
      1 ds Gratted nutmeg
      1 tb Chopped parsley
           Salt and pepper
 
  Pastry
  
  Make the flour into a 'well' on the pastry board, beat the egg and add it,
  with the butter, salt and a little of the water, to the centre of the well,
  then work the ingredients into the flour with your fingertips,
  incorporating more water little by little; whether you have to use all the
  water or not depends on the quality of the flour. Press all the dough
  together into a ball then, finally, work it thoroughly with the heel of
  your hand, gathering it up with pastry scraper as you do so until it is
  soft and pliable. Leave it in the refrigerator to firm up again before you
  roll it out.
  
  Filling
  
  Peel the onions. Cut them into fine rings and weigh out 300 g.
  
  Cook the bacon strips (which need to be VERY finely cut) in the butter. Let
  them take on a golden colour, then add the sliced onions and leave them to
  cook gently until they are tender.
  
  In a bowl beat together the cream, milk and eggs, adding salt, pepper and
  nutmeg to taste.
  
  When the onions are cooked, add them to the mixture in the bowl and add the
  chopped parsley.
  
  Preparation
  
  Roll out the dough 2mm thick and use it to line a buttered tart tin 26 cm
  in diameter and at least 3cm deep. Cut a disc of aluminium foil of the same
  diameter as the tin and place it on the pastry. Weight it down with a
  handful of beans or crusts.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 150 oC (300 oF) and cook the pastry 'blind' for half
  an hour. Watch the coulouring of the edge and as soon as it starts to turn
  golden remove the aluminium foil and beans or crusts. Cook the pastry shell
  until the base is baked but not coloured.
  
  Fill the shell with the onion mixture. Put the tart back into the oven.
  Check that the temperature is still 150 oC and keep the oven at or just
  below this temperature for about 1 hour. Towards the end you could reduce
  the heat a little, as the tart needs TO COOK VERY SLOWLY. The tart is ready
  if, when you shake it, the filling appears to be quite firm with no hint of
  a whole in the centre.
  
  Serve warm, in small slices !

  * Chop stems and leave caps whole In a large saucepan, combine 6 cups water
  with the lemon juice, add the mushroom caps, and bring the liquid to a
  boil.  Simmer the mushroom caps for 6 mintues, transfer tham to paper
  towels, and let them drain. (Blanching the mushroom caps will prevent them
  from wrinkling while they are baking.) In a skillet, cook the bacon over
  moderate heat until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels, and let it
  drain.  Pour off all but 1-1/2 tbsp of the fat from the skillet, in the
  remaining fat cook the onion, the garlic, and the mushroom stems over
  moderately low heat,stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add
  the soy sauce, the sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the bacon,
  crumbled, and pepper to taste. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minutes,
  or until it is slightly dry, divide it among the mushroom caps, mounding
  it, and transfer the stuffed mushrooms to a jelly-roll pan. The mushrooms
  may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered tightly
  with plastic wrap and chilled.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 tbsp bread crumbs
  over the mushrooms and bake the mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 325
  F oven for 7 minutes, or until the filling is heated through. To make the
  filling crisper, the cooked mushrooms may be put under a preheated broiler
  about 4 inches from the heat for 1 minute. Garnish the mushrooms with the
  scallion.  Makes 24 stuffed mushrooms.

MMMMM-------------------------CHAMPAGNE SAUCE------------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Oyster juice - from above
    1/2 c  Champagne - or other dry
           -sparkling wine
    1/4 ts Celery seed - ground
           Freshly ground white pepper
      2 c  Rock salt - or coarse salt
           -for the broiler pan
 
  * 2 cups rock salt - or coarse salt for the broiler pan
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  PREPARATION: Open the oysters as instructed in previous recipe ("Opening
  Oysters in the Microwave").  Measure 1/2 cup of the strained cooking liquid
  and reserve.
  
  CHAMPAGNE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a 1-quart glass or ceramic measure or
  bowl, uncovered, on high for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup reserved oyster
  juices and Champagne and cook, uncovered, on high, stirring twice during
  cooking, for 4 minutes or until thickened. Recipe can be made to this point
  a few hours ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING: Heat the broiler with rack set at its highest level.
  Stir celery seed and white pepper to taste into the sauce. Spread 2 cups of
  coarse or rock salt in the bottom of a broiler pan to steady oysters.
  Nestle reserved shells into salt.  Put each oyster in a shell and
  thoroughly coat the tops with sauce.  Put under preheated broiler until
  just golden, about 2 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 first-course servings.
  
  NOTE:  This is a simple and elegant classic.  You can prepare the oysters
  and sauce ahead in the microwave, and then broil for a minute or two just
  before serving.  The obvious wine to serve is Champagne. If you choose
  another dry sparkling wine to drink instead, use the same one in the sauce.

      Title: Peppered Seafood Sausage
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
   Servings:  1
 
      1 lb Fish Fillets
           Such As Sole, Flounder,
           Salmon Or Whitefish
           All One Kind Or Mixed
    1/2 lb Shrimp And/Or Scallops,
           Raw, Cleaned
    1/2 c  Packed Cilantro Leaves
      4 lg Egg Whites
      1 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
      2 ts Ground Cumin
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Ground Black Pepper
      5    Feet Hog Casing
           In A Continuous Length,
           Soaked In Cold Water For
           A Few Minutes *
 
  *Note: If hog casing is unavailable, seven 5- by 10-inch pieces of kitchen
  parchment may be used instead.  See end of recipe for related info.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cut the fish into long strips; the shrimp and scallops can remain whole.
  Put the seafood, jalapenos and cilantro through a coarse blade of a meat
  grinder.  Combine the ground seafood with the egg whites, lemon juice,
  cumin, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Rinse the hog casing in cold water
  by letting the water run from the tap directly through it.  (The casing
  should not have any holes.)  Gather the casing up onto the sauce stuffing
  funnel attachment on your meat grinder. Put the seafood mixture back in the
  grinder and begin to grind it through. When it begins to emerge from the
  funnel, tie the end of the casing in a knot, leaving 3 inches of it
  unfilled for expansion room.  Grind the mixture out, taking care not to
  overstuff the length of sausage; it should be about 1 inch wide.  If
  necessary, squeeze it gently with your hands to make this width as you
  work.  Continue with the entire length; you will have about 4 feet of
  sausage. Remove the funnel and use your finger to press out the last
  remaining seafood mixture.  Leave 3 inches for expansion and tie the end in
  a knot. Shape to make it even.  Coil it into a spiral and set it aside.
  Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a large heavy skillet with a lid. Reduce
  the heat so that the water barely quivers.  Prick the sausage with a sharp
  knife pint at 3-inch intervals.  Place it in the barely moving water, cover
  the pan and cook for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the sausage
  rest for 10 minutes before serving. NOTE: If you use kitchen parchment,
  butter the paper and place 1/2 cup of the mixture on each piece. Roll it
  up, twist the ends and tie them securely with string. Poach as directed.

      Title: Phyllo, Eating Well's Low-Fat Method
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  1
 
 
  For appetizers with a lot of style but little fat, phyllo pastries are a
  natural. The paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough can be rolled, folded,
  shaped, seasoned, or filled in countless ways. In typical phyllo recipes,
  however, the layers of dough are freely brushed with melted butter; when
  baked, the butter keeps the thin sheets separate, producing a flaky--and
  fat-saturated--result. We developed a technique in which the leaves of
  phyllo are lightly coated with a blend of egg white and olive oil. During
  baking, the egg whites become crisp while the oil keeps the leaves
  separate. The low-fat technique has an unexpected and welcome benefit: the
  pastries turn out crisper and less oily than those made with pure fat, and
  filled pastires don't become soggy.
  
  Frozen phyllo (or filo or fillo) is available in most supermarkets; it is
  also sold fresh in some Greek and Middle Eastern specialty shops. One pound
  of dough averages 25 large sheets of pastry. Our recipes were devloped for
  full-sized sheets, either 14 by 18 inches or 12 by 17 inches. These
  appetizers work beautifully for entertaining because they can be prepared
  in advance and refrigerated or frozen.
  
  TIPS:
  
  Phyllo Dough is easy and fun to work with as long as it doesn't get soggy
  or dried out. To avoid these potential hazards:
  
     Thaw frozen phyllo in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or
  overnight; this will prevent damp spots that could cause the sheets of
  dough to stick together.
  
     Remove phyllo from refrigerator, and leave unopened at room temperature
  for 1 to 2 hours.
  
     Clear a large work surface before removing phyllo from the box.
  
     Carefully unroll sheets onto a dry surface.
  
     Keep sheets of phyllo covered with plastic wrap or wax paper while you
  work; if the dough is left uncovered for even a short period of time, it
  dries out and breaks into flakes.
  
     Work quickly and with a gentle hand.

 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings: 60
 
      2 tb Poppy seeds
      2 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
 
       Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with
  nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Heat a small heavy
  skillet over medium heat. Add the poppy and sesame seeds and cook, stirring
  until they are aromatic and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn out onto a plate
  to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and salt.
       Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward you.
  With a pastry brush, lightly coat the lower half of the sheet with the
  egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1 tsp. seeds. Fold the upper half over
  to cover the lower half. Brush the right half of the folded sheet with
  egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and fold the left half over
  the seeds. Brush the bottom half of the folded sheet with the egg-white
  mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and fold the upper half over.
  Finally, brush the top with the egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1/4
  tsp. seeds. Cut into 10 short strips using a knife or serrated pastry
  cutter. With a wide spatula, transfer the strips to the baking sheet,
  placing them about 1/2 inch apart. Repeat the procedure with the remaining
  5 sheets of phyllo, egg-white mixture and seeds. Bake the straws for 8 to
  10 minutes, until golden and crisp. Transfer to a rack to cool.
       The straws may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature
  for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
       Makes about 5 dozen straws.

      1 c  Semolina flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      4    Room temperature egg
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Warm water
     10 oz Solid pack pumpkin
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      6    Single amaretto
      2    Egg
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Fresh grated nutmeg
      2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 c  Clarified unsalted butter
 
  For pasta: Combine flours and 1/2 teaspoon salt in processor. Add 4 eggs, 2
  tablespoons olive oil and water and blend until dough comes together, about
  20 seconds. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until
  smooth, about 3 minutes. Wrap in plastic. Let stand 15 minutes.
  
  For filling: Blend next 7 ingredients in processor. Set mixture aside.
  
  To assemble: Cut dough into 6 pieces. Flatten 1 piece of dough (keep
  remainder covered to prevent drying), then fold into thirds. Turn pasta
  machine to widest setting and run dough through. Repeat until dough is
  smooth and velvety, folding before each run and dusting with flour if
  sticky. Adjust pasta machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through
  without folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each run until pasta is
  about 1/16 inch thick, dusting with flour if sticky. Repeat with another
  piece of dough. Lay 1 dough sheet on lightly floured surface. Mound level
  teaspoons of filling at 2-inch intervals, leaving 1/2-inch border along
  edges. Brush dough between filling and along edges with water. Top with
  second sheet, pressing around filling to seal. Trim around filling using
  pastry cutter to create ravioli. Arrange ravioli on lightly floured waxed
  paper. Repeat with remaining dough. Let ravioli dry until leathery around
  edges. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)
  
  Stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into large pot of boiling salted water. Add
  ravioli (in batches if necessary) and cook until just tender but firm to
  bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to bowl. Add butter and toss
  well. Divide among 8 plates. Sprinkle each with freshly grated Parmesan
  cheese if desired. Top with freshly ground pepper.

      Title: Roasted Garlic
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  1
 
           Whole Heads Of Garlic
           Toasted Rounds French Bread
           Softened Sweet Butter
 
  Preheat oven to 375ºF. Remove the papery outer covering of whole garlic
  head, but do not seperate the cloves or peel them.  Place as many whole
  heads of garlic on a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil as there are
  people to be served.  Fold up foil so that the cloves are completely
  wrapped. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 15 minutes. Serve each diner
  a head of garlic and some bread and butter. Separate cloves. Hold a clove
  over a piece of buttered bread and squeeze. The garlic puree will pop out,
  like toothpaste from a tube. Spread and eat. GARLIC PUREE: To make a batch
  of Garlic Puree for later use, let roasted heads of garlic cool, unwarapped
  for at least 5 minutes. Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each one
  over a fine meshed sieve, so that the softened garlic pops into the sieve.
  With wooden spatula or wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve into a
  small container or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  the puree if needed. QUICK PUREE: If you are in a hurry, you may skip the
  refinement of the sieve.  Simply squeeze the cloves, one by one, over a
  bowl.  When they have all been squeezed, use a rubber spatula to push the
  puree into a neat mound cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate
  until needed.  It will keep for months. To keep indefinitely, cover with a
  film of olive oil.

      Title: Samoosas - the Pastry
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings: 48
 
MMMMM---------------------------PUR (PASTRY--------------------------------
    750 ml Cake flour
      1 pn Borrie (turmeric)
  2 1/2 ml Salt
    250 ml Cold water
      5 ml White vinegar
     75 ml Cooking oil for spreading
 
  Preheat oven to 200 'C. Sift flour,borrie and salt into a mixing bowl.
  Combine water and vinegar and mix with flour to a fairly stiff mixture,The
  consistency of bread dough. Divide into 12 balls. Working with four balls
  of dough at a time, roll each into a round the size of a large saucer (15
  cm in diameter). Using your fingers, spread a little oil on each
  round,covering it well so that it does not stick during cooking. Sprinkle
  lightly with flour and place one round on top of the other, oily sides
  together. You will now have two rounds, each made up of a double layer of
  dough. oil and flour the tops in the same way as before. Sandwich these
  together to form a single pile of four rounds. Each layer of which has been
  oiled and dusted with flour. Repeat with remaining balls of dough.
  
  Gently roll out piles of rounds on a lightly floured board to a 25 cm
  diameter circle or oval. Turn the pastry from time to time. Place the
  rolled out pastry on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 2-3 minutes or
  until the pastry has puffed up slightly. Remove from oven and cut into
  strips 6 cm wide and 25-30 cm long. Then separate into thin layers before
  the pastry cools down. Cover with a damp cloth to prevent the pastry from
  drying out.
  
  Now hopefully I don't confuse you on this next part! My diagram is supposed
  to represent the strip of pastry 6 cm wide 25-30 cm long. Fold #1 corner
  over # 2, Then fold the # 2 triangle over # 3 this will have created a
  pocket where the filling goes into.

  Fill the pocket with one of the samoosas filling recipes. You then continue
  folding the triangles to seal off the opening. Seal off the small remaining
  edge with a paste of flour and water, Then lightly pinch two bottom edges
  together to puff it up before you fry it.
  
  Once the filling and folding has taken place, You deep-fry the samoosas in
  hot oil over medium heat, turning once or twice to ensure that they are
  evenly cooked. When golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
  paper towel.
  
  Makes 48 samoosas.

  1 1/2 tb Oil for frying
 
  Servings: 10
  
  Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl.  Make well in
  center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk.  Whisk to smooth
  batter then add remaining milk.
  
  Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces.  Pat
  dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half.  Pour 3/4 cup milk into
  saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer.  Add all fish except shrimp.
  Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink remove all
  fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve for sauce. Place
  butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for 2 minutes, then pour in
  reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir and simmer for a few minutes
  until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat to low, add cheese and parsley and
  season to taste with salt and pepper. Add fish, mix well.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat.  Lightly grease it
  with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan. Turn pan
  so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60 seconds, turn
  and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate. Continue with
  remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for 10 pancakes.) Place
  an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in center of each pancake, fold
  the sides over filling and arrange in ovenproof dish just large enough to
  hold pancakes. Place in oven for 20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot
  through.  Serve immediately.
  
  These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will appeal to
  the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when in need of
  refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own protective shell.
  These can be served as a first course or as a luncheon dish for four, with
  a green salad and a very chilled white wine.

  CUT THE FISH IN 1-INCH PIECES. Place all ingredients except casings in a
  food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Or, pass all the
  ingredients through a meat grinder fitted with medium holes. Stuff the
  mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap. Poach
  the sausages in gently simmering water for 5 minutes, drain and let cool.
  If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove it when sausages
  are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To serve, grill the sausages or
  place under a preheated broiler. Since the sausages are already cooked, we
  want only to reheat them and crisp their skins.

    1/2 c  Flour
           Salt
      2    Eggs; beaten
  1 1/2 c  Shredded coconut
           Oil; for deep frying
      1 c  Bottled cocktail sauce
    1/4 c  Crushed pineapple
 
  This Hawaiian-style shrimp dish came from the Safari Steakhouse restaurant
  in the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu.  The shrimp are heavily coated
  with shredded coconut before being deep-fried and served with a pineapple
  cocktail sauce.  Ono nui means "very good" in Hawaiian and this dish
  definitely lives up to its name.
  
  Roll the shrimp in flour seasoned with salt, then dip in the beaten egg.
  Roll the shrimp in the coconut, covering thoroughly.  Deep-fry the shrimp
  in oil heated to about 350 degrees until browned and cooked through, about
  3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Mix the cocktail sauce with the
  crushed pineapple.  Serve the shrimp with the sauce on the side.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Celery salt
    1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
 
  Toast crumbs
  
  Grind the shrimp very fine.  Cream the butter until soft and add the ground
  shrimp, mixing well.  Then add the seasonings and combine thoroughly. Place
  in an oblong baking dish and sprinkle toast crumbs over the top of the
  shrimp mixture.  Brown in a hot oven (400) for about three minutes. Cool
  and place in the refrigerator until time to serve (for several hours at
  least.)
  
  This paste is not as firm as the preceding one, and it has a much more
  buttery flavor.  The nutmeg is quite noticeable, although it blends well
  with the shrimp. --Mrs. Walter Pringle

  table (with bowls of warm water for softening) with a platter of fillings,
  so that guests can make a meal of them. One half fresh pineapple, peeled,
  eyes removed, halved, cored and thinly sliced, 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced,
  1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves,
  coarsely chopped Nuoc Cham dipping sauce, with carrot shreds DIRECTIONS:
  Cook shrimp in salted, boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, or until pink and
  firm to the touch. Drain and cool. Peel and devein shrimp, or serve them in
  their shells and let diners peel them at the table. Blanch bean sprouts in
  boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and refresh with cold water.
  
  To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds, or
  until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened rice
  paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts, tomato,
  cilantro and/or mint. Roll up the bundles and serve with Nuoc Cham.

      2    Cans Tomato Sauce
  1 1/2 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
      1    Paprika
      1    Salad Oil Again
 
  Note: You'll need four skewers approximately 10-12 in. long. Also the
  french bread should be the long and narrow kind cut into 1/2 inch slices.
  The raw tomato is also cut into 1/2 inch slices. The cans of tomato sauce
  are 8 oz. You'll need 28 pieces of cheese to equal the number of slices of
  bacon. Cut the cheese into 1 in. squares about 1/4 in. thick. Fold a slice
  of Canadian bacon around each piece of cheese. Press the bacon firmly to
  hold the cheese in place. Cut each piece of tomato and each piece of bread
  in half. Heat the 1/3 cup of oil in a large skillet. Brown bread on both
  sides. Be prepared to turn bread quickly to avoid burning. It should be
  merely light brown. On each skewer thread alternate pieces of bacon wrapped
  around the mozzarella, bread and tomato. Begin and end with the bacon.
  Place each skewer in a shallow baking pan or shallow earthenware casserole.
  Be sure the folded top of each piece of bacon is up. Pour tomato sauce over
  each skewer. Sprinkle generously with parmesan cheese. Sprinkle lightly
  with paprika and additional salad oil. Preheat the oven 400ºF. Bake the
  skewers until brown on top. Serve immediately while very hot.

      Title: Smoked Stuffed Artichoke
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  4
 
      4    Artichokes, fresh ones
           -have tight leaves
      2    Green onions, finely
           -chopped
      6 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Mushrooms, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      3 tb White wine
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Ham, cooked, finely chopped
      1 tb Parsley, chopped
 
      Trim tops and leaves of artichokes with scissors and cut stalks level
  with base.  (I would cut off the top third of the artichoke and cut off the
  tips of the leaves remaining to remove "spikes".) Put artichokes into a
  kettle of boiling salted water and simmer about 35 to 40 minutes or until a
  leaf can be pulled out easily. Drain, refresh under cold running water, and
  let stand upside down until cool.
      To make the dressing:  Saute green onions slowly in 2 tablespoons of
  the oil, until just tender.  Stir in mushrooms and cook 2-3 minutes; then
  stir in bread crumbs and cheese.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and let stand
  until cool.  Stir in wine, lemon juice and remaining oil. Season well with
  garlic salt, salt and pepper, then add ham.
      Prepare each artichoke by pulling out some of the center leaves until
  the choke can be reached.  (I'd just cut off about the top third of the
  artichoke and the choke would be reachable.)  With a teaspoon, scrape out
  all the hairy choke.  Fill each artichoke with dressing and top with
  parsley.  Wrap each artichoke in foil, leaving the top open. Place on
  smoker grid and smoke for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

MMMMM------------------------PHYLLO TART SHELLS-----------------------------
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"

MMMMM-----------------------SMOKED TROUT FILLING----------------------------
      2 pk Cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)
    1/2 lb Trout fillets; smoked, skin
           --and pin bones removed
    1/3 c  Scallions; chopped (2 scall
      4 ts Horseradish; well drained
      1 c  Cucumber; shredded
 
      To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly
  coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, whisk
  together egg white, oil and salt.
      Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
  lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet smoothly on
  top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the sheet down. (Once
  you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush with the egg-white
  mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth sheet on top but do not
  brush it.
      With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
  crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake for 8
  to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the tartlets to a
  rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 4 sheets of
  phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked tartlet shells may be stored in a
  closed container at room temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to
  2 months.)
  
       To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
  cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions and
  horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely mince the
  smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream cheese, scallion and
  horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked filling may be made ahead and
  refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly before serving, spoon or pipe about
  1 heaping tsp. of filling into each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded
  cucumber.

      3    Eggs; separated
      1 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter; melted, cooled
 
  These proportions make an eggier-tasting crepe.  Beat the egg yolks with
  part of the milk, add flour, sugar, salt, beat well.  Add remaining milk
  gradually, then melted butter.  Beat egg whites stiff.  Fold into crepe
  mixture.  They either may be cooked in the usual way in a crepe pan or put
  into a large buttered pan and baked in a preheated 375F oven for about 25
  to 30 minutes.  This then becomes something like a flat souffle that can be
  topped with a filling or one can be put over half the batter, the rest
  poured on top.  It can be a sweet filling like strawberries or apples and
  may be flavored with lemon rind, brandy, or vanilla.

    1/4 ts Salt (optional, see note*)
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sour cream or soured milk**
      1 tb Seasoned salt (optional)
           Kosher salt for sprinkling
 
  * Leave out the first salt if using seasoned salt ** (My note) works OK
  with 1/2 tb lemon juice in milk thickened with extra milk powder to make
  1/2 cup. Sprinkled salt did not stick very well, suggest mixing in the
  desired amount of regular salt. Spices may mix more evenly if combined
  first with the flour.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt and baking
  soda into a bowl or food processor.  Cut in the butter.  Add the sour ceam
  and salt or seasoning.  Mix to a soft dough.
  
  Roll out PAPER-THIN on a floured board.  Cut in 1 1/2" squares or shapes
  and sprinkle with salt (see note).  Bake on ungreased baking sheet about 5
  min.  Remove the thin pieces that brown first if necessary and give the
  other pieces a bit longer to brown. Turn off heat and crisp in the oven.
  Makes about 3 small cookie sheets of "crackers" almost touching or may be
  cooked in larger sheets to break up after cooking.  May be rolled between
  sheets of wax paper 1/4 to 1/2 of the dough at a time.
  
  Keep for snacking in an air tight jar. Suggestion - divide the dough and
  the spices in thirds.  Mix and bake the first pan and taste so that
  seasoning or salt can be adjusted.  OR make some spicy and some just salted
  and cut them different shapes so you know which are which.

     To make filling: Put spinach with water still clinging to the leaves in
  a large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until the spinach is wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh with cold water. Squeeze the spinach
  quite dry and chop. In nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add
  scallions and saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
  medium-sized bowl and stir in spinach, feta, Parmesan, dill and lemon
  juice. Season with salt and pepper. Beat egg whites lightly with a fork and
  stir into the spinach mixture.
  
      To form phyllo rolls: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 350
  degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray or line
  with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and
  salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
  you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the egg-white mixture. Repeat this
  step with a second sheet of phyllo and set on top of the first. Spoon
  one-quarter of the spinach filling along one long edge. Tuck in the side
  edges and roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
  Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4
  rolls in all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
  sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a serrated
  knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.
  
  The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance. Reheat
  in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated through. Makes

      2 ts Garlic, finely minced
      2 ts Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Thyme (the dried type)

      1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
      2 tb Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
    1/3 c  Parsley, finely chopped
      4 tb Parmesan, fresh grated
      1    Egg yolk
      3 tb Olive oil (extra virgin is
           - best)
 
      Preheat oven to 450F.  Trim off the ends of each zucchini.  Cut each in
  half crosswise.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the centers,
  leaving a shell at least 1/4-inch thick.  Reserve and finely chop the
  scooped-out portions.  There should be about 1-1/2 cups. Pour enough water
  to cover the shells into a saucepan and boil.
   Add the shells and simmer 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.  Clean and finely
  chop mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups.  Heat butter in heavy
  skillet and add onions and garlic.  Cook briefly, stirring, and add
  mushrooms and lemon juice.  Stir and cook one minute.  Add the chopped
  zucchini, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cook about 3 minutes until the excess
  moisture evaporates.
      Spoon and scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and let cool slightly.
  Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs, the parsley, 2 tablespoons of the cheese and
  blend thoroughly.  Stir in the egg yolk.
      With 1 tablespoon of the oil, brush the inside of a baking dish big
  enough to hold the shells in one layer.  Spoon an equal portion of the
  filling into each shell and smooth over the top.  Blend the remaining 2
  tablespoons bread crumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese and
  sprinkle over the top of the stuffed zucchini boats. Sprinkle evenly with
  the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
      Place the dish in the oven and bake 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  NOTE FROM ME:  I cut the finished zucchini in half to serve more people
  before "saucing". Recipe from Pierre Franey's column, "The 60 Minute

 Categories: Dips, Appetizers, Microwave
   Servings:  1
 
    1/2 lb Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Dry
           (Not In Oil)
      2 c  Water
     10 md Cloves Garlic, Peeled
  1 1/2 ts Oregano, Dried
  1 1/2 ts Thyme, Dried
  1 1/4 c  Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD: Combine tomatoes, water, garlic, oregano and thyme
  in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish.  Cover tightly with microwave
  plastic wrap. Cook at 100% in a high-wattage oven for 8 minutes. Prick
  plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well.
  Re-cover and cook for 8 minutes longer.  Prick plastic to release steam.
  Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well and allow to stand, stirring
  occasionally, until cool and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Transfer
  to a 1-1/2-quart souffle dish.  Pour 3/4 cup of the olive oil and the
  vegetable oil over the tomato mixture. Cover tightly with microwave plastic
  wrap and cook for 5 minutes.  Prick plastic to release steam. Remove from
  oven and uncover.  Stir and allow to stand until cool. Transfer to the work
  bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl
  and stir in remaining olive oil if serving immediately. Otherwise, pack in
  a refrigerator storage container with a tightly fitting lid. The dip will
  keep as long as a month, so think about making the whole quantity.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over med heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to a
  simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Cook with
  oil, garlic, oregano and thyme over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes.
  Puree. Above makes 3 cups. Author's note: The sun-dried tomato dip is a
  real breakthrough.  At a recent cocktail party, 7 guests demanded the
  recipe. Buying sun-dried tomatoes dry in bulk instead of packed in oil
  makes them less expensive. Reviving them in the microwave means that you
  can use a minimum of liquid for optimum intensity of flavor. Then they be
  packed up in good quality olive oil (much better than that which comes with
  them in jars) to use as needed or to turn into this dip, with its rich,
  mystifying flavor.  The dip keeps for weeks in the refrigerator. You will
  want to have the ubiquitous sliced raw vegetables; fennel does well with
  this dip. You don't have to use a microwave oven; you can still make this
  dip even if it is slightly less intense in flavor. The reward is the
  cooking water. Save it to use for boiling pasta. Cooked either way, this
  dip makes a delicious pasta sauce. Below are timings for other amounts of
  sun-dried tomatoes so that you can multiply and divide the recipe as you
  want.  Almost every informal party requires at least one dip. Allow 1/4 cup
  per guest.  At bigger parties, I often supply two or three, spacing them
  around the room(s) with dippers at each location. MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD:
  FOR 1/4 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 1 cup water in a 2-1/2 quart souffle
  dish, cook, covered, at 100% in a high-wattage oven 5 minutes; prick
  plastic to release steam; stir; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. In a
  low-wattage oven, cook 9 minutes and 9 minutes. FOR 1/2 POUND DRIED
  TOMATOES: With 2 cups water in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish,
  cook in a high-wattage oven 8 minutes, then 8 minutes. In a low-wattage
  oven, cook 12 minutes and 14 minutes. FOR 1 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 4
  cups water in a 5-quart casserole, cook in a high-wattage oven 14 minutes,
  then 14 minutes.  In a low-wattage oven, cook 20 minutes and 20 minutes.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in a nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to
  a simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Recipe

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  BLANCHING TECHNIQUE: Bring 1-quart of water to boil. Submerge tomatoes in
  boiling water for 3 minutes to reconstitute. Take 4 aside and cut into
  strips.
  
  In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, Parmesan, olive oil and
  remaining sun-dried tomatoes.  Process until smooth. Place in refrigerator
  for about 30 minutes, or until firm enough to shape into a ball. Place
  cheese ball on a platter. Arrange basil leaves and reserved tomato strips
  around cheese ball like a sunburst. To serve, spread on your favorite
  crackers.
  
  Makes 2-1/2 cups.
  
  Recipe from Melissa's brand Sun-dried Tomatoes.
  
  This recipe was called "Dried Tomato Dip" but I sure didn't see it as a dip
  so I renamed it.  I guess it could be a spread, but sure can't see
  "dipping" anything into this as it would be too stiff.

      Title: Sur Le Gril Chopped Liver
 Categories: Appetizers, Beef, Entertain
   Servings:  4
 
      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver
      2 tb Salad Oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 lg Spanish Onion, Chopped
      1    Egg, Hard-Cooked, Mashed
           Salt
           Freshly Ground Pepper
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy
  skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
  translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
  heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
  liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
  piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
  seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough. For finely
  mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a wire
  strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and
  sieve them separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
  place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat
  and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and
  adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning
  liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
  with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread. By Sur Le Gril's chef
  Claude Dubourg. From The Gazette, 91/02/06.

  pan place the eggs and cover them with cold water.  Bring to a boil and
  simmer for 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat and remove the eggs from the pan
  with a slotted spoon and cool them under running water.  Tap each egg all
  over with the back of a spoon to crack the shell thoroughly, but carefully
  keeping the shell on and intact. Bring the water in the pan back to a boil
  again, add the tea, star anise, salt, soy sauce, cinnamon, and soaked
  tangerine peel.  Stir, then add the cracked eggs to the pan. Simmer for an
  hour, turning the eggs often to ensure even coloring. Remove the pan from

  remove the shells.  Serve the eggs cut into halves or quarters, with plum
  sauce.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings. NOTE: These are best when made the

      Title: Tulip, Crab, and Asparagus Appetizers
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
   Servings: 25
 
      3 oz Cream cheese; softened
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Minced chives
      1 ts Minced fresh dill or mint
           -(Optional)
      1 ds Pepper or cayenne
      1 c  Crab meat, flaked
     25    Fresh asparagus spears
     25    Tulip petals
 
  In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper; stir in
  crab.
  
  Break tough ends off asparagus.  Blanch in 1 inch of boiling water in a
  large skillet with a lid, or steam standing upright in a couple of inches
  of water in a tall, narrow pot, until crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes,
  depending on thickness of stems.  Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1
  minute; then pat dry.  Trim asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the trimmings,
  cut as many 1/4-inch rounds as you have tulip petals.  Save extra ends for
  salads.
  
  Fill each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture and
  garnish with an asparagus round.  (If your petals are large and asparagus
  thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.) Arrange asparagus
  in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip petals alternately (or create
  your own pattern).

      Title: Vidalia Onion Tart
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  6
 
           Filling
      2 lb Vidalia sweet onions
      2    Egg yolks
      6 tb Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 lb Bacon; cut in strips
      1 ts Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Peanut oil
           Pie pastry; see below
           Pie pastry
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Salt
      6 tb Cold water
 
  FILLING: Slice onions thinly and layer in large saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of
  salt to them and set aside to draw out the water for at least 30 minutes.
  Add 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of water.  Steam onions until transparent
  and water is cooked out.  Meanwhile, place sliced bacon in a small amount
  of water in a shallow pan and blanch to remove excess fat. Bacon should be
  limp.  Pour off liquid and coarsely chop.  When water is cooked out of
  onions, add 1 teaspoon of flour and stir to dissolve.
  
  Remove from heat and add 2 egg yolks and cream with the onions. Stir
  constantly.
  
  PIE PASTRY: Sift flour onto a pastry board, cloth or dough bowl and make a
  large well in the center. Pound butter to soften slightly or have at room
  temperature.  Place butter, egg yolks, salt and smaller amount of water in
  the well and work together with the fingertips of one hand until partly
  mixed.  Gradually work in flour, pulling dough into large crumbs using the
  fingertips of both hands.  If the crumbs are dry, sprinkle over a
  tablespoon of more water.  Press dough firmly together - it should be soft,
  but not sticky.  Work on a lightly floured board, pushing dough away with
  the heel of the hand and gathering it up with a dough scraper until smooth
  and pliable.  Press dough into a ball. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap and
  chill for 30 minutes. It can be stored tightly wrapped in the refrigerator
  for up to 3 days.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Roll pastry to about 1/2 inch thickness in a rectangular shape.
  Place pastry on an oiled baking sheet. Crimp edges of pastry if desired.
  Beat an egg yolk with a pinch of salt and brush over the entire pastry.
  This is called "egg glazing" and helps the filling adhere to the pastry.
  Pierce pastry with a fork in several places to prevent bubbles from forming
  while baking. Spread onion mixture over the pastry and sprinkle the chopped
  bacon on top. Bake at 300 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely
  borwned. Cut into 1 inch squares for hors d'oeuvres. May be made a day
  ahead and reheated. Wait to cut until after heating if made ahead. May be
  baked in individual tartlet pans or a pie plate. From "Sweet Vidalia

    1/2 lb Japanese eggplants; -=OR=-

           -=OR=- Red Wine Vinegar
           Salt
           Coarsely ground pepper
           Fresh herbs for garnish
 
  PREHEAT OVER TO 400F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl and set
  aside. Cut 5-or-6 long slits in the eggplant (fewer if you're using
  Japanese eggplants) and place a slice of garlic into each slit. Wrap the
  eggplant, together with the bay leaf and thyme branches, tightly in foil
  and bake until completely soft all over--45 minutes-to-1 1/2 hours,
  depending on the size of the eggplant. If you're using the large eggplant,
  turn it over after 45 minutes and continue baking until soft to the touch
  and tender at the stem end. When done, remove eggplant from the oven, open
  the package and let sit for 5 minutes or so. Discard any liquid. When the
  eggplant is cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh away from the skin, put
  it into a food processor and add the yogurt mixture and the olive oil.
  Process until smooth, but leave a little texture. Stir in the lemon juice
  or vinegar to taste and season with salt. Turn the puree into a serving
  bowl and season with pepper and fresh herbs, such as thyme leaves and
  blossoms, marjoram or oregano. If those herbs aren't available, use some
  chopped parsley or scallions. Serve the spread at room temperature with
  crackers, pita bread or bread toasted and brushed with olive oil.

      6 md Zucchini
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Pine nuts
      2 tb Virgin olive oil
      1 sm Red onion
           - diced into 1/4-inch pieces
           Pepper
      2    Garlic clove; minced
    1/2 c  Chopped basil
           - (loosely packed)
      3 tb Parsley, minced
    1/4 c  White wine or water
      2    Eggs
    2/3 c  Parmesan, grated
      3 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
      8 tb Unsalted butter; melted
           - (or a mixture of
           - butter and olive oil)
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Remove filo pastry from freezer and let it come to
  room temperature while you prepare the filling. Unfold the dough, and cut
  the stack of sheets in two. If you are making just one recipe, refold half
  the dough, and wrap it in plastic. It can either be refrozen or kept for a
  few days in the refrigerator. Cover the sheets to be used with a sheet of
  waxed paper covered in turn with a damp kitchen towel, to keep them from
  becoming dry and brittle. Grate the zucchini on the large holes of a hand
  grater or in a food processor. Toss with the salt and set aside for 30
  minutes. Then drain and squeeze dry in a clean kitchen towel. Roast the
  pine nuts for 5-to-8 minutes in oven, chop them finely, and set them aside.
  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and saute the onion until it begins
  to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the zucchini, season with freshly ground
  black pepper, and cook another 4 minutes; then add the garlic, basil,
  parsley and white wine or water. Cover for 3 to 4 minutes, and remove from
  heat. Beat the eggs, stir in the cheeses, then cook the vegetables. Check
  the seasoning. Brush a 9-by-13-by-2-inch pan with the melted butter and lay
  a sheet of filo pastry with butter, or mixture of butter and olive oil, and
  continue buttering and layering, until you have used half the sheets.
  Scatter half of the chopped pine nuts between several of the layers. Brush
  the top layer with butter and spread the filling over it. Continue layering
  the rest of the pastry sheets. If the butter begins to congeal, reheat it
  so it spreads easily. Cut the assembled pastry into 3-inch squares, then
  into diamonds, making sure you cut through all the layers; refrigerate the
  pastry if you will not be baking right away. Bake in a preheated 400F oven
  for 40 to 50 minutes, or until browned. Serve the pastries warm from the
  oven, slightly cooled, or at room temperature. Makes one 9-by-13-inch filo
  pastry.
